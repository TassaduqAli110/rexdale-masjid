          Just after a year this musalla, shifted to a bigger location to accommodate 100-125 worshippers. \
          In 1992 it again relocated to a still bigger unit with praying capacity of 150-200. \
          During the year 2001 the existing unit was extended by adding one more unit, thus maintaining the total praying capacity of 300 - 400.


Alhamdulillah, this musalla being one of the oldest facilities, serving successfully the neighboring Muslim community for over 20 years.
